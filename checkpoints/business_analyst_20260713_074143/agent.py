=================================
Business Analyst Agent — turns approved requirements into epics/user
stories, a full BRD/SRS, personas, process flows, and risk/success-metric
analysis. Owns its own prompt (prompts.py) and schema (schemas.py); the
pipeline orchestrator only ever calls `.generate(...)`.
