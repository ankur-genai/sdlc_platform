UI/UX Agent — designs screens, user flows, wireframes, a full design
system (typography/spacing/palette/components/breakpoints/a11y), and the
pre-frontend style-option gallery the user picks from before any frontend
code is generated. Owns its own prompt (prompts.py) and schema

- Draw a REAL screen: background fill, top bar / nav, headings, cards, form
  fields, buttons, tables/lists, icons drawn as simple shapes, and realistic
  placeholder text relevant to this screen — using the palette hex values above.
- It must look like a finished screen, NOT a wireframe of grey boxes.
- Self-contained and inert: no <script>, no <foreignObject>, no external
  images or fonts, no CSS @import.
- Output ONLY the SVG markup. Do NOT output an ellipsis ("...") or any
  placeholder — every element must be fully drawn.
