   - Define specific requirements from each framework
   - Provide implementation guidance

3. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS:
   - Define what needs to be audited
   - Specify audit frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
   - Identify required evidence and documentation
   - Assign responsibility (role/team)

4. DATA RETENTION POLICIES:
   - Identify all data types requiring retention policies
   - Define retention periods based on regulations and business needs
   - Specify secure deletion methods
   - Provide legal/regulatory justification
