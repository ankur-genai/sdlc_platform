"""
ws_manager.py
=============
Manages WebSocket connections and broadcasts Section-16 events to every
client subscribed to a given project_id.

Usage in main_extension.py
---------------------------
    from ws_manager import manager
    await manager.connect(websocket, project_id)
    await manager.broadcast(project_id, WsEvent(...))

Section 16 event types supported
----------------------------------
    agent_started         — fired when an agent_run transitions to running
    agent_completed       — fired when an agent_run transitions to completed/failed
    artifact_generated    — fired when a new generated_artifact row is committed
    approval_requested    — fired when an approval row is created (status=pending_approval)
    approval_completed    — fired when an approval is decided (approved/rejected/published)
    review_completed      — fired when a review_result row is committed
